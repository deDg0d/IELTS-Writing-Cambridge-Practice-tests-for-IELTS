Task 1:6(6-6-6-5)

The charts below shows the number of households in the US by their annual income in 2007, 2011, and 2015.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting main features, and make comparisons where relevant.



The chart depicts the population of US citizens based on their average income in a year in 2007, 2001, and 2015.

Overall, income distribution remained relatively the same in all period. While changes in 50,000-74,999 group was the lowest, the population of people with the highest annual income altered severely.


Relatively speaking, the pattern for those who had annual income less than 75,000 dollars a year remained the same with respect to each other. In all years, more American get paid between 25,000 to 49,000 $ on average a year. This population peaked at nearly 30 million in 2011. This number for 50,0000 to 74,999 was almost constant, which is the only group with this feature. The same number for first income group, those who made less than 25,000 a year, started from 25 million in 2007 and peaking at almost 28 million reached to 27 million in 2015.


The trend for other two groups, namely, 75,000 to 99,999 $ and  more than 100,000 was exactly the same with the same fluctuation. In 2007, the former's population was nearly 15 million while the latter was roughly 30 million. After witnessing a subtle decline in both, they reached their peak at 15 and more than 30 million, respectively.  








Task 2:6.5-7(7-7-6.5-6.5)


In many countries around the world, rural people are moving to cities, so the population in the countryside is decreasing. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?



Today, many people from rural areas opt to live in larger cities; thus, fewer people live in countryside. In my view, this is a negative development since it will cause more pollution in the city, and discourage the governement from erecting construction projects in countryside.

First and the foremost reason for this negative development is the governement being less reluctant in creating more facilities in rural areas. In other words, officials usually decide to construct new facilities, such as hospitals and schools, if there was demand for them. Hence, they will not consider dedicating funds for such projects since they will not be economically justified. For example, erecting a school in coutryside where most of its people is leaving there to live in the urban area of the city would lead to having a school with many empty classes.


The next principal reason why this migration is negatively affecting society is city pollution. Simply put, by having more people in the city, more vehicles are needed to satisfy their need for transportation. Consequently, This growth will lead to air pollution, which is harmful to all citizens. That is not it; higher populated cities often will caused other types of pollutions, particularly those related to sounds. More people means louder streets, noisier banks, and companies. For example, people could suffer from a headache each time they went to banks for transferring money. Such noises have negative effect on the mental aspect of individuals. 

In conclusion, current trend of people moving from countryside to city has major drawbacks, chief among which are poor development in rural areas and unbreathable air or louder environment.
